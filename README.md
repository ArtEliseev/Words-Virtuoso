# Words-Virtuoso
My eleventh project in JetBrains Academy

Description

In this stage, let's add some colors to the clue strings.

Change the structure of the clue string now, they should be in upper case, with different background color for each letter. These colors are:

Green if the letter in the guess word occurs at the same position as in the secret word.
Yellow if the letter occurs but in some other position.
Grey in any other case.
For example:

Secret word	Guess word	Clue string
spare	steak	
clone	cloth	
snack	daisy	
liner	datum	
For setting the letter background colors, use the 8-bit ANSI colors (256 coloring scheme). More specifically, the color sequences are:

Color	Sequence
Green	"\u001B[48:5:10m<letter>\u001B[0m"
Yellow	"\u001B[48:5:11m<letter>\u001B[0m"
Grey	"\u001B[48:5:7m<letter>\u001B[0m"
Where <letter> is the letter the background color of which we want to change. The clue word letters should be individually colored.

The wrong letter printouts will have an azure color background â€” 

For this, use "\u001B[48:5:14m<wrong letters>\u001B[0m" , where <wrong letters> is the wrong letters' list. The wrong letters should be group colored.

Objectives
Implement the coloring scheme as defined in the Description. Each
